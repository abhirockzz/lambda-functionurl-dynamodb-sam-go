# Quickstart guide - Sample serverless app with Lambda Function URL, DynamoDB and SAM

Demonstrates how you can use Lambda Function URL to write a simple application backed by DynamoDB. You will be able to invoke an API endpoint exposed by the Lambda Function URL,which in turn will execute operations (`GetItem`, `PutItem`, `Scan`) on DynamoDB. The function is written in Go using the [DynamoDB package](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/service/dynamodb) in [AWS Go SDK](https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/) and [AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/what-is-sam.html) is used to quickly build and deploy the solution.
