# Quickstart guide - Sample serverless app with Lambda Function URL, DynamoDB and SAM

Deploy a sample serverless app that exposes an HTTP(s) endpoint using [Lambda Function URL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-urls.html) and inserts an item into the Amazon DynamoDB table when it's invoked.  The Lambda function itself is written in Go (makes use of the [DynamoDB package](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/service/dynamodb) in [AWS Go SDK](https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/)) and we use a SAM template to get the job done, quickly!
